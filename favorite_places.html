    <h1>My Favorite Places in the World</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Throughout the years, I've traveled through the mysterious wodl with only a few hundred dollars in my wallet.  At first I thought it might be stressful to just go out to the unknown with nothing, but sometimes the unkown isn't as bad as people make it to be.  I've heard stories about being careful when going to a third world country because people are poor and desperate, they'll rob you. You're American!!  This wasn't the case for me, I actually found people living in poverty to be the most gracious and generous people I've met, ever! Along the way I was able to couch surf from the slums of india to the temple of monks in Thailand.  I even couch surfed a billionares house!! I would have never been able to experience any of this if it was for me planning out my vacation months in advance and planning how much i would need to save and how much I would spend.  Here are my top 5 favoirte places that I found to be the most beautiful in the world.
